## Introduction

This project involves various text mining tasks on a book from Project Gutenberg. The tasks include tokenization, frequency analysis, stopword removal, stemming, POS tagging, and regex matching. The results and code are provided in this repository.

## Tasks

### Task 4a: Book Selection

- **Book:** “Alice in Wonderland” by Lewis Carroll.

### Task 4b: Tokenization and Frequency Plot

Tokenized the text, counted occurrences for each token, and plotted the results with log frequency on the y-axis and log rank on the x-axis.

### Task 4c: Top 20 Tokens

Printed a list of the top 20 tokens.

### Task 4d: Tokenization without Stopwords

Repeated tokenization and frequency plotting after removing stopwords.

### Task 4e: Stemming and Frequency Plot

Repeated tokenization and frequency plotting with stemmed text. Explained the differences in count occurrences between original counts, after removing stopwords, and after stemming.

### Task 4f: POS Tagging Mistake

Showed one example sentence where POS tagging made a mistake and explained the mistake.

### Task 4g: Proper Nouns Tag Cloud

Ran POS tagging and created a tag cloud of proper nouns (NNP, NNPS). Explained whether it corresponds to what is known about the book.

### Task 4h: Regex for Repeated Words

Wrote a regular expression to find all strings with two consecutive repeated words (with potential punctuation between them). Ran it on the text and reported any found instances.
